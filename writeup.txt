Fot this homework, the program is contained in the file named hw4.py. The values of the files are hardcoded into the progam and it currently contains file WSJ_24.pos as
the input file.

The prior probability and transition probability work fine and can be tested against the test.pos file(which contain the exact example from the nlp slides with fish sleep).

I was unable to fully implement the vertibi algorithm and have commented out the algorithm as it would cause the program to crash. Theoretically i know how the algorithm
works but i was unable to properly implement it.
